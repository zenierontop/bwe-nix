# BonziWORLD Enhanced

**This bonziworld respository houses the source code to BonziWORLD: Enhanced.**
<br>
The source code has been made public because I would like to move on from this project and work on something else. Since it's just been sitting here collecting dust, I figured I should make this public. Who knows, maybe somebody will find this useful.
